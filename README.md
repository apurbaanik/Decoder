# Decoder
Verilog Module for a 3-input decoder using primitive instantiations, Continuous assignment statements and Conditional statements. Then we will write a testbench to simulate the 3 modules and verify using the waveforms. Verilog is a hardware description language for describing hardware from transistor level to behavioral. Verilog description consist of modules which is basic unit of hierarchy that describes boundaries (module to endmodule), input and output and behavioral codes (conditional statements, continuous assignments) etc.
